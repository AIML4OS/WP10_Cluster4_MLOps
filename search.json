First, data augmentation is performed by adding new text entries (e.g. text like “groceries” or “beverages”) to the dataset, adding multiple newly generated text values to each household to enrich the data. Adding a variety of new textual entries helps the model to generelize better. Secondly, we clean the data by removing punctation and handling missing values.",

Each categorical variable has a predefined set of valid input classes, since the model can only handle known classes. All known inputs are translated into this set of classes. Unknown inputs are set to their respective “unknown” category.",
