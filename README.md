This tutorial is aimed at providing a step-by-step guide for MLOps pipeline building. It will sift through the main building blocks of an ideal MLOps pipeline, while providing feedbacks and example implementations from three NSIs (France, Germany, Austria) and other partners.

This work was carried out as part of [Work Package 10](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/book-page/aiml4os-wp10-text-code-experiences-and-potential-use-aiml-classifying-and-coding) (Automatic Coding) of the [ESSNet AIML4OS project](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/dashboard/aiml4os).

Special thanks to our colleagues from the [WP2](https://cros.ec.europa.eu/book-page/aiml4os-wp2-communication-and-community-engagement) for providing this tutorial [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python).
